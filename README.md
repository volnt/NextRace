# NextRace

Webapp based on [NextRace - Path of Exile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.volent.poenextrace).

I made this Android app in June 2013 and it's really ugly and I could improve a lot of things.

The problem is that I don't enjoy writing Java at all and so I decided to restart the project using HTML & JS.

I don't plan on replacing the original app very soon because it seems that the webapp is a LOT slower than the native one.

# Features

For now the webapp can :

* Fetch the races online
* Store them locally
* Display the stored races
* Refresh the stored races

I would like to add some functionnalities but the fact that it is much slower than the native app demotivates me.

# Run

You can't just open the index.html in your browser, you have to launch a HTTP server for the app to work.

For example `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` should launch an HTTP server on http://localhost:8000.
